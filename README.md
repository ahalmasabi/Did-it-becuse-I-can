This is a repository where I share some of the code I've written for fun and learning.
I like to experiment with different languages, frameworks and libraries, and see what I can create with them.
Sometimes I follow tutorials, sometimes I just try things out on my own. I don't have a specific goal or theme for this repo, I just do it because I can and for joy.
